STEPS TO BREAK DOWN THE CODE INTO SMALLER CHUNKS.

When a player hits easier or hard that then sends off the request.

Get the question and check it's not been asked in this round yet.

Then go to a play question method?
*** BUG - Try and do it so the clue buttons are disabled until the film has been got?? Sometimes if you hit next question and then clue 1 very quickly you'll get the clue from the last film.***

Get clue.
Check guess - if someone hits submit.

Maybe try and do it so players can have two guesses after each clue - to help with typos or issues like The Iron Giant vs Iron Giant.

If guess is right then check how many questions they've had and on next question onclick go to a new question.

If it's the final question then the text for Next Question button should change to Get Final Score.

Then a separate function can give you your score and image.
